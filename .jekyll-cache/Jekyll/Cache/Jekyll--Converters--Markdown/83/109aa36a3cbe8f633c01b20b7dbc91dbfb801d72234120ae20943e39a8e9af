I"§<p>For a number of years, we ran a ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Open When‚Äù section of our portal, which was manually updated by a member of my team whenever a holiday or break was upcoming.  This manual process wasn‚Äôt especially difficult, but it was certainly time consuming.  The final product was also a simple table.  I saw that there was an opportunity to create a tool that could be updated by those making the schedules, and which could provide much better information to the end user.</p>

<p>This project heavily utilizes one of my favorite Wordpress plugins, <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/">Advanced Custom Fields</a>.  I utilized Roots as a starting theme, customizing some of the standard Bootstrap colors and styling.</p>

<p>Each location is a post in this system, and each post has a number of custom fields - a place to show an external schedule rather than the default hours, a place to indicate if a location is closed for an extended period of time (over the Christmas holiday, for example), and a place to put the normal and any special holiday hours.</p>
