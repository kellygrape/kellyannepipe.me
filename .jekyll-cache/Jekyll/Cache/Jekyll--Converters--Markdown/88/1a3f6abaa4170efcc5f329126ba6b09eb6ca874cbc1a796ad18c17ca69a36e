I"<p>Redesign of main campus map, including development of custom Wordpress backend and integration with the Google Maps API. Released in Spring of 2015 as a replacement for former map feature.</p>

<p>There were a few iterations of the design; initially the design was based more heavily on Bootstrap, but I decided to simplify, making an over-all easier navigation experience and a faster load.</p>

<p>Each location is a single post item with a number of custom fields.  I configured Wordpress to write a json object of all locations when any single post is edited and saved.  The front-end is a custom map utilizing the Google Maps API, consuming the JSON object that has been generated by Wordpress.</p>

<p>I utilized the <a href="https://github.com/toddmotto/html5blank">HTML5 Blank theme</a> as a starting point, which also opened up the ability to use gulp, SASS, and some basic code linting.</p>
