For a number of years, we ran a "What's Open When" section of our portal, which was manually updated by a member of my team whenever a holiday or break was upcoming.  This manual process wasn't especially difficult, but it was certainly time consuming.  The final product was also a simple table.  I saw that there was an opportunity to create a tool that could be updated by those making the schedules, and which could provide much better information to the end user.

This project heavily utilizes one of my favorite Wordpress plugins, [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/).  I utilized Roots as a starting theme, customizing some of the standard Bootstrap colors and styling.

## Custom Article Layouts

Using the Page Builder tool enabled me to deliver a number of custom layouts, really making each article shine.  I created three different base layouts that can be applied to new articles, and each base article template has a number of customizable areas, allowing us to drop in additional quotes, media, or other rich content elements.

For special articles such as our yearly "Outcomes" piece, the content of the base template can be completely removed and a totally custom page can be developed.  The outcomes article I have presented below is an example of this; I was able to create an online version of the beautifully designed print piece, allowing visitors to consume the data in an engaging way no matter what medium they are accessing it with.
