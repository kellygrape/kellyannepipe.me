Department heads at Saint Joseph's University wanted to showcase lists of faculty on their departmental websites, but the faculty profiles were configured within our Drupal installation on the main website.  Utilizing JSON from Drupal's Views, I built a bridge between the two systems.  I created a custom page template that when used within a Wordpress site would display a listing of the faculty for any given department.  I also included a dashboard widget which would provide instructions on how to create a faculty page.
